# Rock Paper Scissors (Player vs Computer)
Play the all time favorite rock-paper-scissors game against a computer🖥️!

A simple Python console game where **Player 2** plays Rock–Paper–Scissors against **Player 1 (computer)**.
The computer picks randomly, and the game keeps score for a few rounds.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- You enter names for Player 1 and Player 2.
- Player 1 (computer) chooses randomly:
  - `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`
- Player 2 types their choice in the console.
- The game plays **2 rounds** (you can change this).
- Scores are updated after every round, then the final score is shown.

---

## ✅ Valid Inputs

Player 2 must type **exactly** one of these (lowercase):
- `rock`
- `paper`
- `scissors`

If you type something else, the game will tell you to type a valid option.
